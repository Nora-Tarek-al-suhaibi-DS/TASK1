# Diabetes dataset:

## Description: 

The Diabetes dataset, which includes medical information helpful for creating prediction models to identify if a patient has diabetes, is a frequently used dataset in statistics and machine learning. Here is a summary of its structure:

## Data summary: 

Number of samples : 768 Number of attributes (features) : 8 predictor variables + 1 target variable Target variable : Outcome (binary: 1 for diabetes-positive, 0 for diabetes-negative).

## Library Import:

Library Import: Import pandas, numpy,and seaborn for data handling  visualization. Import train_test_split, StandardScaler from sklearn for data splitting and scaling, and GaussianNB, LogisticRegression for models.

## Dataset Features:

* Pregnancies: To express the Number of pregnancies.
* Glucose: To express the Glucose level in blood.
* BloodPressure: To express the Blood pressure measurement.
* SkinThickness: To express the thickness of the skin.
* Insulin: To express the Insulin level in blood.
* BMI: To express the Body mass index.
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: To express the Diabetes percentage.
* Age: To express the age.

## Applications:

The dataset is useful for testing classification algorithms like logistic regression in medical data prediction, focusing on early detection and prevention of diabetes.
